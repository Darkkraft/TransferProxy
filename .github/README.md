## 🌐 Overview

**TransferProxy** is a proxy for Minecraft, harnessing the power of the new transfer packet feature introduced in Minecraft 24w03a
(release in 1.20.5). This feature allows server-to-server transfers, opening up a myriad of possibilities for server networks.
Whether it's for large-scale server networks or small private servers, TransferProxy aims to provide a versatile and
efficient solution for Minecraft server management.

Here are the project features:
- **Performance**: The project was designed to be lightweight and inexpensive in terms of resources. It is capable of supporting thousands of requests simultaneously.
- **Plugins**: The project works with plugins, which allows you to create your own redirection rules.
- **Community**: The project aims to be community and collaborative, suggestions are appreciated.
- **Wiki**: Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/Darkkraft/TransferProxy/wiki), if any information is missing feel free to make an issue.
 
## ⚙️ How to use ?

TransferProxy works with a system of plugins, it is thanks to these that you can configure the redirection rules or the motd.
There are several ways to set up TransferProxy. The simplest use is to download it in the "release" section and set up a plugin or develop one.
